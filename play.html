    <h6>ALICE.</h6> <p4> Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.</p4> 
    <br>
    <p5>[_Exit_ L.C.]</p5>
    <br>
    <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6> <p6>Good morning, Gerald.</p6>
    <br>
    <h6>GERALD.</h6><p7>[_Rising_.] </p7>
    <p8>Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.Allonby.</p8>  
    <br>
    <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6> <p9>[_Sitting down_.]</p9> <p10> We came to inquire for your dear
    mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?</p10>
    <br>
    <h6>GERALD.</h6> <p11> My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p11>
    <br>
    <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p12>Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
    night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
    was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
    on one’s nerves.</p12>
    <br>
    <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  <p13>It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p13>
    <br>
    <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p14>I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
    afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
    Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p14>
    <br>
    <h6>MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p15>[_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]</p15>  <p16> It looks
    quite the happy English home.</p16>
    <br>
    <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p17>That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
    One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
    Gerald.</p17>
    <br>
    <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  <p18>Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
    a good influence is the worst in the world.</p18>
