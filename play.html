    [GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]
    <br>
    [_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]
    <br>
    ALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.
    <br>
    [_Exit_ L.C.]
    <br>
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.
    <br>
    GERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.
    Allonby.
    <br>
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear
    mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?
    <br>
    GERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.
    <br>
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
    night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
    was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
    on one’s nerves.
    <br>
    MRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.
    <br>
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
    afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
    Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?
    <br>
    MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks
    quite the happy English home.
    <br>
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
    One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
    Gerald.
    <br>
    MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
    a good influence is the worst in the world.
